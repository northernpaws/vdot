# TODO

## Models

- Add some kind of support for VRM models (i.e. VRoid studio).

## Tracking

- Support [FaceCap](https://www.bannaflak.com/face-cap/) [Wifi streaming](https://www.bannaflak.com/face-cap/livemode.html) for iPhone-based facial tracking.
- Add lip-syncing support, maybe something similar to [uLipSync](https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync) since that's used in VTube Studio.
- Add [MeowFace](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=MeowFace&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) tracking support
- Add VSeeFace tracking support
- Mediapipe Face tracking
- Use [Unified Expressions](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/tutorial-avatars/tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes) as the standard for all face tracking
- Use XRFaceTracker as an interface for face tracker support. It's currently experimental and not provided through godot_cpp.
- Look at supporting ALVR tracking (https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/pull/2461), talk to Grillo in nullptr about it later.
